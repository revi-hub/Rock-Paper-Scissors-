/*
Player chooses the ü™® Rock, üìú Paper or ‚úÇÔ∏è Scissors.
Then the computer randomly chooses ü™® Rock, üìú Paper or ‚úÇÔ∏è Scissors.

If both, the computer and the player choices are the same it's a tie.
If the computer choice is ü™® Rock and the player is the üìú Paper - player wins, if the opposite - computer wins.
If the computer choice is ‚úÇÔ∏è Scissors and the player is the ü™® Rock - player wins, if the opposite - computer wins.
If the computer choice is üìú Paper and the player is the ‚úÇÔ∏è Scissors - player wins, if the opposite - computer wins.
